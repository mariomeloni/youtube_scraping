in hindsight it's a very woke democrat story
This dont look the bit as interesting as the show
"Yall do know ""they"" desperately want this to be a reality"
film bagus. semua agama. ini mirip kilafah tapi versi kristen. wajib semua nonton. gak akan nyesal..
It's like the show without any of the actual disturbing aspects. Even the handmaid's uniform looks elegant. Why does it look like some bad lifetime romance thriller. lmfao
Can we all admit that most films from the 80s-2000s aged TERRIBLY? The show did a MUCH better job at representing how scary and sinister this world is.😊
omg!!!
"Looks good for its times, but Hulu series is a masterpiece."
"Pretty sure Faye Dunaway ain’t having a baby in 1990, dystopia or no."
I kind of like how the whole think just screams it was made in the 1980s/1990s. This is such a different vision than the today TV show
The start of the trailer explains a lot. The book just gives clues.
Looks better than the stupid show
RIP Natasha Richardson 🙏🙏🙏❤️
Difícil conseguir la película de los 90s
"Wow, Harold Pinter / Volcker Schlondorff.  How did I miss it?"
"1984 was so bad, this probably is better and the new versions are total trash."
This looks way better than the awful series
I never knew that was a movie adaptation before the series until now.
i love old movies 😁😁😁😁😁❤
"This was an excellent movie for the 90s. Ahead of its time. Of course, the current one is better. But this one often gets unfairly criticized."
"i remember watching this on a local channel,wayback 93'.then i saw these on my fb newsfeed...i want to watch it again"
I'd like to watch it.  Seems pretty close to the shield on hulu
1:29 am i trippin or does that look like the same exact window in june's room in the show?! that would be cool if they used some of the same locations
who ened up here because of Mark and Claire Headley #blownforgood
"""Republic of Giliud"""
Looks like a cheap soap opera to me
Haha this is so corny compared to the show and weird to see because I’m like whose who . Who’s the nick of this movie ? Whose commander fred and Serena?
Reminded me of that “We have…” so and so at home meme 😄
"The American Government watched this film and realized its Sheeple STILL wouldn't realize this is what they have been working towards for many decades. They believe it all to be Fiction. 
Maybe only outsiders can see it..."
Not the DVD box cover having Natasha look all sexy like it's hot being a handmaid. 😭I can't wait to watch this as I have a sneaking feeling it will capture almost none of the fear and dystopia of women's rights being obliterated by Gilead.
"think about the times... tv has changed so much with the subscription channels etc... there are more ""dark"" shows now and the type of tv that pushes the envelope so to speak could not exist in the early 90's. There is no way any movie interpretation of the book could come close to Hulu's back then."
"Even though this movie may have not been the best adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, I do like the dreamlike quality that this seems to have."
I had no idea a 1990 version of The Handmaid's Tale existed!
So Muslims.
It’s time Boys! 😁😁😁
Hated this film.
Can’t believe that is the head teacher and the dad from Wild Child!
They’re making this movie harder to find
"i was always a little skeptical when ppl say ""hollywood's been making far left garbage for years"" but now i've seen this trailer"
Great cast!
Leftist  garbage
"Fast Forward to 2022:  I had never heard anything about it until recently.  I don't have Hulu.
In 1985 I was a young mother of two and never went shopping for best sellers; so, never even saw it advertised.  In 1990 never saw it advertised.  I heard the name more recently, but, never paid attention at all.  I figured it must be some kind of romance novel.
Now I see on the news women rudely interrupting worship service wearing getup reminiscent of the pilgrims and I had to find out what it was about.  If I wasn't a Christian I guess I might feel like all these protesters, too.  But, I am, and I actually resent the whole thing, now that I know what it is about.
Christians would never do what is in that book and movie.  And certainly God never commanded  the Old Testament characters of Rachel and Leah to do what they did.  You see, the Holy Bible tells   what people did, warts and all.  It doesn't hide anything.  Keep that in mind if you read or see The Handmaid's Tale.  But, actually, I would not advise it.
Read God's Word instead."
Why did the trailer tell the whole story-
"Whoa! Time out! (I say that if I am shocked.). I didn’t know that this was a movie back in 1990. This is the first time that, I heard or seen that, there is a movie based on the book of the same name. That’s awesome!"
Much better looking handmaid than the fugly one that did the remake.
I did not know there was a movie of the handmaid‘s tale. This series is really good it took me an entire month to finish it
"N. H. II- Poems of Joy 1-5 and N. H. II- Humble Poems 1-5 are on YouTube, and here is a link to one of them:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjksOsSKXw"
"Man, if I had seen this trailer when it came out, I would’ve been soooo pissed that they’d given away SO much of the plot in this trailer. Why do trailers do that so often?!? It’s infuriating lol"
"I personally like this version. I caught it by chance one night in the 90s, it had already started, and I remember being very intrigued by the story, didn't know why they were all dressed in red. I didn't know what the title was until the hype went up five years ago for the news of the Hulu series, so I found out it was another version of that very weird movie I saw that night. Immediately purchased the book and at once I was sucked in and watched the series. That's why I don't dislike this first rendition, it has an important role in my love for The handmaid's tale."
I think this movie was on AMC about 10 years prior to the show. The movie was only aired once on TV. The movie made Natasha Richards more well known till she died 8 years before the show began.
Eu aqui achando que era novo
The lady in the thumbnail lowkey looks like Gabby Hanna lmao
This film was just bad 😂
I've seen all 4 seasons and I'd rather just have this and the book. The show drags cus of Moss.
Shocked that this was actually a movie !!!
I’ve never heard of this movie. It must have gone straight to video.
So this is what Cora is doing when she's in America?
Was this a movie or a series?
"This movie is more accurate to the book IMHO, it's just so hypocrite that the racism is gone on hulu's version, also I wonder how they would manage the serie without copyingcat Lost and black mirror all the time, I like hulu's but it overhyped"
Lol this trailer gives away the whole story
"Gilead, Texas"
Texas brought me here
This looks like a good ensemble cast in this movie.. Victoria Tennant also played the evil mom in Flowers in the Attic...
This looks like a good ensemble cast in this movie.. Victoria Tennant also played the evil mom in Flowers in the Attic...
É O QUEEEEE?? 🤯
So there’s a sterility crisis…. these “bad guys” seem pretty good
the tv show is much better
the morally corrupt Faye Dunanway?! from the OJ trials and housewives?! oh hell
This looks more like a soap opera
This looks terrible. LMAO!
What’s terrifying is that our society is getting ever so close to this.
Very apt for what is going on now..THEY produce films to let us know their plans ..FACT
"At least they used some good looking actors in the movie, that ugly shrew on the TV series would make it very difficult to get it up so you could get her pregnant, and she is the lead actor in the series."
Predictive Programming.
the shitty acting ruins it. no one seems exceptionally bothered that theyre under totalitarian rule lmfao
This is hilarious. It’s like Dallas 😂😂😂
"The Hulu take on this makes me think something like this could actually happen. Especially when June says that she was asleep before but now she is awake, and she didn’t realize what was going on until it hit everyone like bricks (my words interpreted.)"
"The disgusting sphere booly strengthen because slice nomenclaturally talk atop a cloistered needle. private, new toothpaste"
Hell of a cast damn. So many legends 🙏
I was looking for a new show to watch and I hadn't had anyone really tell me about this show.  I saw the poster and  I thought it was a period piece. And its starts with a car chase. I was confused. But 4 seasons later I'm still here. This show is awesome and I'm only just learning that there was a movie of it.
"So, THAT's what it's about...huh, go figure."
"These are all great actors but after Hulu's version, the only June in my eyes is Elizabeth Moss."
its not a patch on the TV series
Es la mama de las gemelas de Disney
Wow! What a cast! Still won't watch it (I did read the book though).
"it’s a damn shame that natasha richardson (offred) passed away, she was a great actress. aidan quinn (nick) was and still is so extraordinarily handsome; those eyes are dreamy."
"First it was The Shining mini series I found out about and now The Handmaids Tale, jeez it’s like I’m going through a Mandela effect right now and I don’t like it."
So much better than the show
The only thing that bothers me here is that handmades are wearing make-up
Blond actress looks so much like Timonthy Chalamet
"Honestly, these scares me out more then the horror movies, because it is more realistic. Just scary."
Is recent future grammatically correct ?
wow this was soooooooooooo disappointing compared to the series. I'm actually very upset that i wasted my time to watch.
"She can't get pregnant by the man who protects her in terms of finance/security.
So she aims to get pregnant by another man.

Alpha fux, beta bux. Perfect female fantasy. Wrapped in all kinds of mental gymnastics."
This embarrassingly bad.
This Offred is beautiful.
geez that looks worse than the old atar wars movies
I had no idea that handmaids tale was based from a film
"I remember when this first came out.  Critics absolutely shit on it.  I ended up renting it several yrs later after reading the book and it wasn't great, but not as awful as many would think.  It's just peak early 90's cinema.  The series is a million times better, but this was a good start."
Wow
So did they understand the story or?
"This looks absolutely terrible

I want to see it"
"The awful push lately dare because citizenship transmurally behave save a fat faulty racing. faded, next noodle"
This film was so bad.
"Damn, this is like the trailers from Grindhouse. It's really hard to accept that they were still like this within my lifetime and I was just too young to remember."
"The gleaming operation medicinally guide because vise counterintuitively waste barring a smelly catamaran. piquant, axiomatic road"
Spoiler alert omg
"Oh snappp!
I much find where I can watch this!"
"I mean, I know it was a different time then but for what's it worth, I feel like though the book is quite old, it was kinda ahead of its time. Hence why the TV show is much more slappy than this, but it's still good nevertheless. And good dystopian societies have their citizens not knowing better.... until one rebel wakes up and realises. 
RIP to Natasha Richardson as well, not her best performance in my opinion, but still can't deny her talent.
Religious hypocrisy has always been one of the most long-standing issues in society,  but hey this is a satire of several things about humanity. How many parallels this genre has may be more subtle than others IRL."
Elizabeth McGovern played Moria she and Fay Dunway should be in the series
It blows my mind how trailers in the past have narrators. I kinda miss that sort of thing. HAHAHAH
Well the good/awful people of Giliad certainly lacked the spark of their modern counterparts.
Trailers used to be so awful.
"This subject matter: of The Handmaid's Tale - it's dark waters - but it never seems to dance on the screen.  It's so clunky.  The directing, acting editing...  I am a filmmaker, and I know it's hard work: so I don't me to sling mud.  It's just that I wish projects like these had more flow..."
This looks more like a venezolan telenovela.
The Acting is so bad it feels like a 70's porno😂😂😂
looks porn kkkkkkkk
The show and trailer along with the photo give me nothing but make gaze vibes
Wow lol I didn’t even know a movie with made ... this looks like the Disney version or the lifetime version of the show lol
a lot of big stars but i never heard of it
This doesn't look entertaining at ALL. No wonder I don't remember it growing up. The acting in this looks like a dry run in a high school theater production. Now the show is the best show on TV right now. Bless the early 90's... I mean- they tried lol
"Holy shit, young Cora Crawley"
RIP Natasha Richardson
The acting is TRASH!
"This looks nowhere near as terrifying as the new HULU show, so glad they remade it. However, im still interested in watching."
The red outfit looks so much better in this one with the red veil
Going to look for this on Prime. LOL
"Ick. So glad they remade it.

""We get out together baby"" 😍

Ugh, vom."
Omg Natasha Richardson i didn't know she was playing here 💔
"The successful motorboat extremely box because sister bacteriologically kick unlike a goofy slipper. ruthless, whimsical geology"
Aaaah! The good old times where the video was the highest form of communication!
"Oh God, they really took Hollywood liberties with this one"
"This trailer went over 2 seasons at least of the show, they need to stop dragging stuff out 😹"
The Show is darker!
Let's all remember that this movie came out in the 90's. Times were different. They were only allowed to show so much back then compared to today's time. I think it still looks intriguing to watch.
What’s sad is that this story is a happier one than what’s going on in some places of the world today.
"This looks nothing like the newest one, I never understood how they enslaved the women who can have babies and not the ones who can’t... literally treat those ladies like crap!"
""" once upon a time in the recent future""  does that even make sense ?"
It Cora from Downton Abbey.
before the sjws took over and made it about #orangemanbad
Is this girl from episode of Miami Vice?
"I want to like the miniseries, but only about a quarter of each episode I watched was interesting."
I remember this film being much more affecting than the trailer would make it seem. Haven't seen it since i was in my early teens though. I read the book a few years after seeing the film. The series is great because it's been so cleverly updated to reflect our society and make the fears truly relevant to a modern audience.
"Back when the handmaids tale was a reaction to the Iranian islamic revolution, before it was twisted into a pro abortion attack on Donald Trump."
too much chatting for handmaids
"this is not a trailer, this is a whole ass movie"
It’s weird how crappy this is. Like they didn’t even try to make it a scary world for women. It’s just the cool new thing everyone is doing now.
So stupid
Hahahahahhaaa
"Crazy awesome cast
Seriously odd trailer, though.

The Hulu/Elizabeth Moss incarnation is 1000% superior."
"The abundant biology unlikely stop because bamboo eventually number plus a successful wealth. depressed, juicy feet"
"Now we know it's not the women with fertility problems, eh ?"
"""Once upon a time in the recent future""
What the FUCK is the ""recent future""?"
Starring Natasha Richardson and the sound mic.
"The show was at lot darker and more frightening. I haven’t even seen the movie but from this trailer, it comes off as a romance"
I really liked the original film with the late Natasha Richardson. Such a shame that she's gone. 😥🙏
Faye Dunaway there would make me want to try the theory that we need a handmaid.
This looks like shit after seeing the tv series.
Natasha was maybe too beautiful for the part. Elisabeth Moss is just homely enough.
"I had no idea about this movie. The cast is amazing, but It looks weird."
They should make this into a show
Burdaki oyuncular 2017 versiyonuna göre daha iyi seçilmiş😍😍
I was today years old when finding out there’s a movie 🤯
Aiden!
Natasha!
The old and new one are still just as horrific. Let's hope this never happens like it did in the movie/show-
"No sabía de esta película, hasta hoy que me la ha recomendado YouTube"
Wow I did not know this existed 😅
Not even one POC was in the trailer lmao
This looks like it would have been pretty good back in the day.
trump !!!!!!!!!
They was a movie?????
Too creepy. Definitely can’t handle this one
It's incredible how this movie from 1990 looks like 1980
This had some big names! Cheesy AF though. 😄
"Or, from the Commander's pov: the Handmaid's Tail."
RIP Natasha Richardson !
This looks very funny
Wow this seems way less tedious than the constant close ups of Elizabeth Moss' ugly mug.
This looks awful.
Is this meant to be a horrific dystopian or a soap opera?
I’ve never seen the movie but the series is both amazing and hard to watch all at the same time.
Some serious actors in this.
"It was very good for it's time. People so critical of a movie made 30 something years ago compared to a massive budget Hulu series . Of course it's dated now but the fact that someone took it on 30 years ago when ""dystopia"" wasn't the buzzword and plot of basically every movie was brave back then. And the cast was great."
Debrow alert! 🚨
I love this show. Hulu did a great job. I had no idea it has been on 30 years. I just recently heard of this Hulu
"Once upon a time in the near future 

My brain melted out of my ears when I heard that"
Ooh! Aiden Quinn!
The 80s are strong with this one....
This was just so bad
And then she gave birth to two Lindsay Lohans
"I may be in the minority here, but I actually did like the movie."
Thank god they took another shot at that 😄
"I tought it was good but could have been better, it had great aesthetic, decent cast and good budget, but the wrong directors."
Praised be that Hulu made the show
This is still my favorite adaptation of the book.
"Great book. Terrible movie.
Too many ""pretty"" people with poorly written lines to read.
And WHY have a man reading the preview dialog? Shouldn't it be a woman's voice, as the entire story is told from a woman's perspective?
I vaguely remember the movie; it wasn't particularly gripping after the producers were done with it, although the concept scared the crap out of me.
Hulu's Handmaid's Tale is the best thing on television! I'll pass on watching the Robert Duvall and Faye Dunnaway version again."
"The really soft lighting/filter/filmstock they used, plus the hairstyles and clothing of the era really make this look like a 1980s CBS TV Movie of the Week."
Idk but the  movie’s got a Spanish Telenovela vibe 😅
Why am I just now realizing this is the mom from the parent trap🤭
This looks like a parody of the Hulu show lol. Not as terrifying.
What!!! There's a movie!
A different tone all together!

The cast in this are phenomenal!
Lol I forgot about the narrator voice and most old movies
"I was 16 when the book 1st came out, & the story has stayed w/ me since then. I remember watching this version of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" & feeling very disappointed, so much so that I forgot I watched it till I saw this video. Every time I watch media created in the 70's & 80's I find it hard to believe we were satisfied w/ the junk they put out - it's terrible. It's like they grabbed people off the street, handed them a script, & started filming. I love how far we've come in how we use movies/TV to tell stories. The attention to detail (sets, clothing, props, music, etc.), showing the destruction/transformation of the world we live in now, how dedicated the actors are to finding the real & complicated feelings of the characters - all of it is has reached the level of true art."
Just jumped in here after knowing they filmed this at Michael Peterson's mansion after watching The Staircase in Netflix.👌🏽
Ofred on here eventually escapes here and had twins - parent trap 😂
"This is why talented writers, directors and producers make all the difference. Same exact story, vastly different outcome."
Yeah the original was weak compared to the TV reboot but it still gave you some thought.
Didn't know there was a movie of it... I need to watch it
Looks stupid
❤🌍🙏❤
This movie was utter shit. The show actually did the book justice.
Eesh the acting. :/
That was a good season 1 recap
"Buscó esta película en español, alguien sabe donde la puedo conseguir?"
Wow the tv show matches the movie perfectly
I do think that making the commander an old guy was a much better casting choice than the steamy bloke they cast in the Hulu series as it reinforces how wrong the situation is.
"“Once upon a time in the recent future...”

Wat"
"Crazy shenanigans similar to the Handmaid's Tale really happen in real life, but never in countries where White people are in charge. Just study what goes on in Africa, East Asia, and the Middle East, and you'll find real-life similarities."
"Prime wants 10 dollars to rent it, when did we have to start paying so much for 30 year old movies?"
Please read important my church going family is part of this regime.. here in America Medford oregon it's the hub they are names Mitchel like me mayou my other name they go by the last names also glassford and yes guess what Waterford yes im in danger my bank card was stolen and they ask demand money from me yet wouldn't tell me what name my foreign bank account is under these people are callous cruel and follow various churches play mind games well its the fellowship church groups the fellowship church...Applegate or applewhite all crazy they are in collusion with CPM a property management company here in Medford to control people i lost my home my possessions are some lost got my federally subsidized housing taken these people are cruel and callous yes this is why Margaret Atwood is a godsend yes our government has gone wrong very wrong and these churches shouldn't be allowed to use our United states constitution to control us its not right yes wrongly indeed CPM real estate Oregon business owners are colluding to use people to control and via these criminal organizations they have installed an authoritarian system here this is true
It makes sense that I saw a Trump ad before watching this video.
this is comical compared to the series
"I remember around 4th grade which was 1989-ish, I met an old man at the tennis courts in our apartments in North Carolina. He told me his daughter or step daughter, something like that, was in a movie. I totally didn’t care and thought he might be full of shit. He told me the movie was called “a handmaidens tale”. He was adamant about me remembering the name. So I remembered it but never saw or heard about it. I’ve thought about it my whole life. This has to be it. It looks interesting. I would really like to see it. I’ll have to look it up."
"I don’t like the way they make this look like a typical husky 80s sex thriller like 9-1/2 weeks. The handmaids tale is about RAPE and a million types of oppression against women and children.  Thank god for the Hulu series. I mean, was Atwood consulted at all about this movie?"
Swear this trailer basically told the entire plot of the movie from start to finish
Suban esta película en español
I love how they all act like they've been loaded up on xanax. Zero emotion. Just flat. Meh. Yvonne and Elisabeth here to show 'em how it's done.
wow I didn't know this existed I've been watching the handmaid's TV show 🤷‍♀️
Serina is way less scary in this version
"Ohhh shoot, i never knew this particular movie existed"
I read somewhere that the director of this movie never read the book
Wow.  I imagined that the whole concept was Trumps plan. I never imagined it dated back this far.  We are SOOOOOO screwed!
the show is so much better!
1:18 Acting and direction straight out of the 80's.
I did not know about it . Also it is nothing in front of the show.
Fuck it feels so weird. The guy who plays Nick made me laugh out loud. How have I never heard of this when Robert freaking Duvall is in it
"RIP Natasha Richardson. She would have been so proud of the series, and she was a wonderful actress. Faye Dunaway is such a legend. She should have a guest role in the series."
"I'm confused, is the girl on the bus guilty of lesbianism or trying to change her gender?"
"Personally, I think that what Margaret Atwood did with her novel of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" has shown about what the important issues were at the time. I really have been impressed with Atwood's vision of a nightmarish world according to her landmark bestselling novel."
add a few boob shots and this could be the 90s softcore porn version of the Hulu show
"Before there was this, there was that!"
Yes people there was a book then a movie (because the book was so epic) 20 years ago. I remember seeing the book in my house growing up.  But yes the series is on another level entirely!!! But they forgot the butter...(read the book or see this movie to understand)
The trailer voice is Darth Vader.
"""The Staircase""
A women was murdered in the house they used in this movie 11 years later."
"Michael Peterson, the 2 time killer brought me here"
The handmaids need their “wings” like in the book.
Caraca só fiquei sabendo agora kkk
This is a bed time story compared to the show
The show is WAY more frightening than the movie.
I never knew they did a 90s version of it. It doesn't look familiar at all but it doesn't look like it holds a candle to the show. It's a little slow but I encourage people to check it out.
I need to see that movie!
"Well this seems like the 80s PG version of the current show, lol."
I saw this after I read the book. It's awful. Hulu's version is much better.
"Yeah I'll pass...June's hair is too styled, Serena looks too kind, the commander offers too much info and everyone else is like ""yeah this is totally normal"" Elizabeth Moss version 100% better 😔"
*_those uniforms make me N U T_*
lol what a shit premise
Oddly that no one had any guns to fight back with. Hmmm
Natasha Richardson was a beautiful woman... RIP
"Okay this comment is for French people and/or foreigners who know French history, but gosh Fred looks like François Mitterrand"
this is so shit lmaooo
I had NO IDEA there was a movie from the 90s
San amant
1990? More like 1977
"I always hear Gilead medical ads on the radio,  they even have stocks."
This is so 90s lol the new one is way better.
oh wow. Robert Duvall as the Commander. that must be interesting
Everyone is pumped full of vaccines and our birth rates are going down...hmm.
I didnt know the story was this old?
"I didn't know this was a movie,  but it looks very close to the book."
Just felt what is living under a rock for 30 years.
so no one is gonna talk about how both the parents from parent trap also play lovers in this movie?
This looks horrible!
So basically Season 1...got it!
Such a hottie she was.
"Nick, the dude who is the driver for the commander in the show resembles the dude from this movie."
That synthesizer score sounds horrible
Lol
Elizabeth McGovern!!! My girl!
These guys copied the show of the same name that is a Hulu Original
At least the chick who plays Offred in this one doent annoy me at first sight.
What??? It was a movie before the Hulu series??? What kind of black magic is this??
I had no idea they had done this.
I loved the show now I’m glad they finally made a movie can’t wait until it comes out.
WOW! I had no idea this was a show before the one we have now.
Praise be🙏🏼
Wth is this? Had no idea this even existed? I thought the book was only written a few years ago?
Natasha was so beautiful
Nem parece a mesma história da série
The cover is look like porn DVD cover
Where can I see the movie
What a cast...❤❤❤
My mom watches this with my grandma.....:/
Ummm ok. We who casted this? It's insane. Amazing
Natasha richardson... faye  dunaway y Robert duvalll
La vi DE  pendejooo. Allá  x 1993.... y.me había  gustadooo
This was before its time! The new tv show has had a completely different reaction because we can now see how easy it would be for something like that to happen ..
This was a great cast! The gal from Downton Abbey is in this! Cool.
I love how they aren’t allowed their clothes but they get to keep their hairstyles! I
"Under his eye, Captain Gregson."
"I remember reading the book & watching this one as a teenager. Thought the whole concept was creepy but watching the new Hulu series & how they made it so modern, makes the whole concept too creepily real."
Soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto!
😒👎
les epouses ont l air moins coincée
I didn't realize that the original movie had such a great cast. I'll have to watch it soon.
"Wow, I never knew"
The threat of a dystopian US future wasn't as imminent back then when there wasn't a complete lunatic as president
OF COURSE Faye Dunaway!!
"Seems this was treated as a romance. The poster reminds me of those romance novel series with subgenres like desire, etc"
"aunque obviamente la serie es mejor que la película, el film es en varios aspectos quizás más fiel al libro original. Aunque la película no es una obra maestra, recomiendo su visionado a todos los fans de la serie"
I didn’t even no there was a movie lol
This looks like an overproduced parody
I seen this a long time ago!!! I was trying to figure this movie out!!
Victoria Tennant's performance just makes you appreciate how good Anne Dowd is all the more.
The preview narration forgot to mention that sterility in Women was also due to excessive ABORTIONS! Funny that they left that one glaring effect out! 🙄 Seeing that the Leftist Liberals love getting and having a right to Abort.
This looks so messy and half baked
Under his eye
They should make a prequel for season 4...
What???This is the first time I hear of a movie. I wonder if its exactly like the book.
It looks like Offred is just ok with everything. No one seems bothered. So weird.
The trailer is literally a spoiler to the entire first season
the 90's were so different from now... let's just say that
Robert Duvall? Wow I didnt know this
Faye Dunaway is and always will be so gorgeous 😲
"GOD this is bad 
The dvd cover looks like it’s a story about some home wrecker breaking that family in the back apart 
I said it’s a dvd and it’s probably a vhs tape"
I wish Nick in the series would be as hot as Nick in this one.
why’s everybody so obsessed with having babies....
Looks like a parody.
It looks like parody of show
Aiden Quinn as Nick. Yea baby
As told by Danielle Steel
"But it s absurd that less women can have children, and men? Are they all healthy? How is that possible? How is that possible that the whole world is not affected by this this problem? It s quite absurd"
Shitry movie
Handmaid's series brought me here but this trailer sent me away. gods the acting is terrible XD
Theres a book too
I had no idea this was a movie .
Anybody seen the series? How is it compare to the film?
honestly just got a whole ass recap of the first season
Alguem assistindo em 2019?
0:38 is that Lana del Rey???😂
I would like to know who the women in white are.
The movie ain't as terrifying and gut-wrenching as the show. But it was alright. RIP Natasha Richardson.
Excellent cast and respectable director.
The standard of the TV show makes the story unbearable to see (in a good way).... The show is more graphic showing a better narrative
Look better than the series
Donde puedo ver la película completa?
this movie is no good
"Aidan Quinn is in my favorite movie of ALL time!!!!! ""Legends of fall"" with Brad Pitt. Adore them!"
Zzzzzzzzzzzd! The tv series kicks this ass all over the planet lol 😁what a snoozefest this looks like and I'm from that era but this looks awful... butchered like Ofglen/ Emily's you know what I'm sorry to say ugh!
"Wow! Such a star-studded cast for what appears to be such a poorly made movie!! No thanks, I’ll just stick to the series."
Como só agora vi isso!!! onde acha pra assistir?
The serie is just superb!!!!!
The Hulu show tries to over sexualise it. In the book Mr. And Mrs Waterford we're both old. Serena had gray hair and walked with a cane. In the show they are both like supermodels.
"I love the way they used to tell the entire plot of the movie in the trailer 😂 awesome cast and incredible story, we read the novel and watched the movie in women’s studies back in 2002 and it was scary then the thought of it possibly being reality. Read the book it is incredible, I promise you. RIP Natasha Richardson 😭 you were amazing"
"Yes je ne savais pas qu'il y avait eu 1 gilm ou une serie dans les années 90,je vais tout faire pour le retrouver. Thank my friends for this trailer"
Every other person was smoking in 1990 apparently
Depressing!!! No thank you!
The show is 10x’s better
RIP Natasha
"Great movie! I loved it. You are missed, Natasha!! ❤️"
This is so the epitome of a late 80s early 90s dark trailer.
I have this on vhs
How did I not know about this?!
This makes me wonder what else is out there Just waiting to be re done and confuse everyone that yours is the original..
OMG! I never heard of the book let alone the movie until this year! I must get THIS!
Why the fuck they look like cults
I love the costume design. Although the visual style is more lighthearted than the Hulu series which is just the bleakest thing I’ve seen on 📺
It looks like a spoof from SNL
Thank God for Hulu's rendition. This was over the top cheesey and no where near as terrifying.
Y Nick Parker extrañaba mucho a su esposa pero se quedó a cuidar de sus pelirrojas hijas gemelas.
Omg Natasha 😭
We need to oppress women now
This doesn't look nearly as frightening and sinister as the show...
"Nossa só tem branco nesse filme, preguiça. Por isso prefiro a série que é mais diversificada!"
The handmaid’s Tale book and show brought me here
Oi?  Então é uma recriação do filme?
Jajaja es buenísimo
The acting seems so bad
Ostras y esta serie?!? Pensaba que solo estaba la del Cuento de la criada del 2017.
"Mds nunca soube desse filme, bizarro ahauahjaiai"
Estou chocada. Nem sabia q ja tinha uma versão de THT
This trailer is so spoilery lol.
I had no idea they made a movie before the show.   I want to watch this
Is that Robert Duvall?!
I need to see this!!
hey Nick is the guy from Practical Magic LOL
How is this compared to the TV series?
I’m here for more of Nick
The atmosphere looks really dark
Hulu brought me here........ plz Bring me back 🙁
the handmaid's tale series brought me here
This movie misrepresents Christians as fascists religious fanatics
I guess I'm the only one who came here for Aidan Quinn.

"I just watched the 8 hours tv series in one sitting, and now I need more episodes lol. The characters in the tv series looks a lot younger, the commander looks like Adam Levigne, his wife a super model and Offred a party girl."
Lady Grantham aka Elizabeth McGovern!!!!

"such emotional faces. what world are they from? today's actors are all like walking talking plastic mannequins with their frozen faces. it's like people were replaced by robots or pods or something in the last 30 years. most important thing they don't get wrinkles though, right?"
all the fancy dresses and gender segregation is exactly like the Nation of Islam has it.
RIP Natasha. xx
