# Youtube Comments Scraping for Handmaid's Tale

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to perform an extraction of comments from the Youtube trailer of the Handmaid's tale, and analysis of the comments.

## Structure
1. Extraction: Extracts the comments via the YouTube Data API;
2. Sentiment Analysis: analysis of the sentiment of the comments extracted
3. Word Analysis: NLP analysis of the most recurring words in the comments, concurrence analysis and topic modeling (WIP)

## Conclusion
This project is still a work in progress; there are ways to enhance both the extraction and the analysis.
The code can virtually be used with any youtube video, by getting the video id (from the url) and using a valid API_KEY for the Youtube Data API.
