41,"Fast Forward to 2022:  I had never heard anything about it until recently.  I don't have Hulu.
In 1985 I was a young mother of two and never went shopping for best sellers; so, never even saw it advertised.  In 1990 never saw it advertised.  I heard the name more recently, but, never paid attention at all.  I figured it must be some kind of romance novel.
Now I see on the news women rudely interrupting worship service wearing getup reminiscent of the pilgrims and I had to find out what it was about.  If I wasn't a Christian I guess I might feel like all these protesters, too.  But, I am, and I actually resent the whole thing, now that I know what it is about.
Christians would never do what is in that book and movie.  And certainly God never commanded  the Old Testament characters of Rachel and Leah to do what they did.  You see, the Holy Bible tells   what people did, warts and all.  It doesn't hide anything.  Keep that in mind if you read or see The Handmaid's Tale.  But, actually, I would not advise it.
